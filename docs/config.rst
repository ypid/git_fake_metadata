Configuration
=============

.. note:: The configuration is currently trusted in that bad things could
   happen when it is specially crafted.

  Special values:

  ``self``
    Only consider the repository itself for plausible metadata.

  ``none``
    Consider no repository for plausible metadata checking, not even the
    repository itself.
